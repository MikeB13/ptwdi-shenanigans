## Shenanigans!
I know how uncomfortable and discouraging it can feel during the first week!

Maybe you feel like the material is too overwhelming, or you feel like everyone gets it except for you, or maybe all these terms we're using don't make any sense. I totally get it. It's gonna take some time to get used to the daily developer life -- all the different programs we use, how each little 'thing' has a different syntax, the weird words we use to classify things, why the hell is this file indented the way it is??

Learning how to code is basically learning a whole nother language. But trust me -- you guys can do this! There is an enormous world of resources on the internet, and all of NYCDA is here to support your learning. As we progress in the course, we'll make cheatsheets and guides to help you work better/faster -- we encourage you to refer to them often and even make your own!


## Slack
Again, if you haven't done so yet, GET THOSE SLACK PROFILE PHOTOS UP! If you have a question about anything, slack it to the group. I'll try to be as present as I can, but if I can't answer it, someone else likely can and will. Be sure to check the shenanigans-main channel OFTEN for all announcements.

Slack is used by many tech companies because it makes communication much more efficient and clear. It has a great search features and integrates well with other technologies, such as GitHub, CircleCI, and Amazon Web Services. What's also cool about Slack is that it in itself is a web app -- it's just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

cool trick: If you press the + sign and click on "code or text snippet", then click on the top-right dropdown, you can select different filetypes and Slack will syntax hi-lite and auto indent the text for you


## Workflow
As developers, our main tool is the keyboard, not the mouse. We want you to get into good habits of using the keyboard. It can be difficult at first to get into this habit, but you will soon realize that the keyboard absolutely destroys the mouse in terms of speed. GET TO KNOW YOUR KEYBOARD -- it will save you a lot of time in your future life as a working developer.

Mac users: [spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) is great for organizing your work space

Take a look at these links and use the keyboard shortcuts that you find helpful:

[Mac keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236)

[Windows keyboard shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/126449/keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows)

These are the bare minimum keyboard shortcuts that EVERY dev should know and use (for windows, use ctrl instead of command):

Mac | Windows | Description
--- | --- | ---
`⌘ + Z` | Ctrl + Z | Undo
`⌘ + Shift + Z` | Ctrl + Shift + Z | Redo
`⌘ + X` | Ctrl + X | Cut
`⌘ + C` | Ctrl + C | Copy
`⌘ + V` | Ctrl + V | Paste
`⌘ + S` | Ctrl + S | Save
`⌘ + R` | Ctrl + R | Reload
`⌘ + F` | Ctrl + F | Find
`⌘ + A` | Ctrl + A | Select All
`⌘ + W` | Ctrl + W | Close tab / window
`⌘ + [number]` | Ctrl + [number] | Switch to [number]
`⌘ + tab` | Alt + tab | Switch windows

## Text editors
Sublime and atom are the most popular text editors used by devs today. They're simple, lightweight, and they both have neat little features such as syntax hi-lighting, file management, auto-indenting, autocomplete, etc.

Every dev has their own personal preference. I believe sublime performs a little faster and has less bugs than atom. I personally prefer atom cause I like the look of it better and it's open source (which means the program itself is free and available to anyone to view, test, download, customize, and even contribute to -- more on this later).

TIPS:
- after every small change, check to see that your change works the way you want it to
- save the file that you're editing BEFORE reloading the browser
- text editors show you when a file hasn't been saved yet
  - atom shows a blue indicator dot
  - sublime shows orange text and a grey dot
- If you're working in an HTML file, and you type the name of the tag, then push tab, the text editor will autocomplete the HTML tag for you.
  - try it out: type the word "link" into an html file, then push tab and see what happens

## Files and Directories
- Create a directory you will use for this class and know where it’s located so you always know where your files are.
- Similarly, always know what file you are editing and be sure it’s the one you intend.
- You can [command-click (hold down ⌘ and click) the proxy icon of a window](http://lifehacker.com/5791407/manage-files-from-their-title-bar-icons-in-os-x) to see where the file is located.
- You can drag files and directories (including proxy icons) onto Terminal to paste their full path into the command line.
- You can open an entire directory of files in Sublime by dragging the directory onto Sublime.

## Debugging
- Read the error message carefully.
- Think about what the error message is telling you.
- Look at the line of code the error occurred on and see if you spot anything amiss.
- Start challenging your assumptions.
- If you ask for help, make sure you include the full error message, stack trace, and the code that is resulting in the error.
